// Regression //
Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a 
dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) 
and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features').

There are many other types of regression analysis, including:
    *Logistic regression: This is used for predicting categorical outcomes, such as whether or not a customer will buy a product.
    *Poisson regression: This is used for predicting counts, such as the number of customers who visit a website in a day.
    *Survival analysis: This is used for predicting the time until an event occurs, such as the time until a patient dies.

Applications:
   *Economics: For forecasting economic growth, predicting demand for products, and assessing the impact of policies.
   *Marketing: For targeting advertising, predicting customer churn, and optimizing product pricing.
   *Healthcare: For predicting disease risk, identifying treatment targets, and assessing the effectiveness of drugs.
   *Education: For predicting student performance, identifying factors that influence achievement teaching methods.
